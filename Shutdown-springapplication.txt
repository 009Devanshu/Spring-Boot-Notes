Method 1:
-----------------
Step1: netstat -ao
Step2: Locate the port on which Tomcat server is running.
Step3: Locate PID and kill the task
       taskkill /F /PID 14836       (14836 is PID)

Method 1A:
----------------
Finding the process ID associated with the application can be automated or programmed using ApplicationPidFileWriter.
 	SpringApplication springBootapplication = new SpringApplication(SpringBootApplicationName.class);  
        springBootapplication.addListeners(new ApplicationPidFileWriter("sbshutdownwin.pid"));  
 	springBootapplication.run();  
PID will be written in the file sbshutdownwin.pid which is in our current working directory from which our application is launched.
Now, the same process as above mentioned.


Method 2
--------------
Shutdown using Actuator endpoint

Step1:
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>

Step2:
management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled = true

Step3:
invoke the actuator endpoint /shutdown via a [POST] request only
http://localhost:8080/application-context/actuator/shutdown     
Here, application-context is nothing but name of the application which can be defined in application.properties 
spring.application.name="spring-boot-application"
